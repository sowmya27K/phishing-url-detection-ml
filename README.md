# Hybrid Machine Learning Based Phishing URL Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting phishing websites using URL-based features and a hybrid machine learning approach. It aims to protect users from cyber threats by accurately classifying URLs as legitimate or phishing.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect phishing URLs using machine learning algorithms
- Improve accuracy using hybrid and ensemble models
- Build a user-friendly web interface using Flask
- Provide secure user authentication with SQLite

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Flask
- SQLite
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- Gradient Boosting
- Hybrid LSD (Soft & Hard Voting)
- Hyperparameter Optimization using GridSearchCV
- **Extension:** Stacking Classifier (RF + MLP + LightGBM)

## 📊 Dataset
- URL-based phishing dataset
- Collected from Kaggle
- Contains over 11,000 phishing and legitimate URLs

## ⚙️ System Workflow
1. URL input by user
2. Feature extraction and preprocessing
3. Model prediction
4. Result displayed through Flask web interface

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

## 🧪 Results
The stacking classifier achieved the highest accuracy and F1-score compared to individual and hybrid models, improving phishing detection performance.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Real-time phishing detection
- Larger and diverse datasets
- Integration with browser extensions
- Detection of other cyber threats
